Javascript Neural Network Class


This class is a simple class that works with vector math to create a neural network. It also has a few functions to give functionality to a neural network. I plan to add more functionality as I learn how to add it.

I have committed two new directories. One with a neural network made from maps and the other made from loops. Both structures can be used in the same way. As I tested the map and loop structures against each other, I found that loops are faster by 0.1 ms when put through the same feedforward situation.
